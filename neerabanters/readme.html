<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Do you wish Neera would interact more with her companions in Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition? Then this mod is for you! The Neera Banters mod adds banters between Neera and other joinable NPCs available in BGEE. There is at least one banter with every* joinable NPC <em>(ok, not quite <strong>every</strong> - there is one exception, for narrative reasons)</em>.</p>

<p>The mod also adds interjections in various dialogues. Currently, only a handful of interjections are added, but more are planned.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Neera Banters is compatible with BGEE and EET. No content is added for Siege of Dragonspear, although it can be installed on BGEE with SoD for the BG1 campaign.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

<h3>Dialogue Banters and Interjections</h3>

<p>This component adds dialogue banters between Neera and other joinable NPCs in BGEE. It also adds interjections by Neera in various dialogues.</p>

<h3>Interaction Banters</h3>

<p>This component adds Neera to the INTERACT.2DA file, which controls the "non-dialog" banters that BG1 NPCs have. Voiced lines from BGEE and SoD are used to create compliments, insults, and responses for Neera.</p>

<p>Also, this component gives Neera a specific reaction to Imoen's and Glint's deaths (no other NPCs do, and Glint has a reaction to Neera's death in SoD).</p>

<h3>DLC Portrait</h3>

<p>This component uses the Neera's DLC image featured on the BGEE startup menu for a character portrait.</p>

<p><em>Starting a new game is <strong>required</strong> for the Interaction Banters and DLC Portrait components, as the Neera character files in any previously saved games will NOT be affected.</em></p>
